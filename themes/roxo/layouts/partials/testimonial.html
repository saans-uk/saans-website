            Therapy is effective not simply just by talking about your problems, that is only the first step.
            But therapy is about working consciously towards your abilities to change the things you can change
            and to accept what you canâ€™t.
          </p>

            Psychotherapy creates a unique space where you can explore your feelings, thoughts and behaviour in
            a non-judgmental, confidential and supportive environment. The therapeutic alliance, which is the
            quality of the relationship created between you and your therapist, is pertinent for therapy to be
            effective and one that fosters self-awareness, trust and change.
