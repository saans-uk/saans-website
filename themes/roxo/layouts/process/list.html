                <h3>How we will start</h3>
                <p>At your first appointment, you will be invited into a private and
                    comfortable space to discuss your
                    personal hopes in therapy. This initial consultation will provide time to discuss any concerns you
                    may have about therapy. </p>
                <p>
                    If you think about it carefully, isn’t the relationship with your doctor, your dentist, your hair
                    dresser, crucial for tending to what’s needed for your body, teeth or hair? Similarly, taking the
                    time to find a good therapist for you is just as important. It is for this reason, I offer a free
                    consultation, you can come in person or have a phone/video call to talk about anything regarding
                    therapy and understand how I work as a psychotherapist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I offer in-person sessions, and video sessions via Zoom, Google Meet, WhatsApp, and FaceTime for
                    those who are not able to can’t come in person.
                    Together, we will also explore the type of psychotherapy that will be best for your needs. You may
                    have a preference for the kind of personal therapist you would like to see and if you feel I may not
                    be the right therapist to work with, I would be happy to enable a referral, when appropriate.

                <h3>Endings</h3>
                <p>
                    How to end therapy is crucial for being in therapy. It is like anything else we may need to reflect
                    on, how to end relationships, friendships or breakups, how to resign from a job, or how to tell
                    someone you love things that hurt you – they’re all about ending status quo and making a change.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
                    As I have said repeatedly, existential therapy is about autonomy, will and choice. Hence, it will be
                    up to you when and how you may want to end therapy. I request and remind my clients to enable two
                    sessions to reflective on this decision and enable it with certainty.
